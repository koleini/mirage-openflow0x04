1. On Xen, some packets are duplicated (check if they original acks are lost or out of sync), resulting Frenetic controller to crash (check the crash reason on frenetic.) Works ok with unix config.

2. Fix warnings.

3. Suggest change to Frenetic:
--
 | FEATURES_REQ -> FeaturesRequest
 is missed from Message.parse, resulting in an exception in switch.
 
--
  can we use page-aligned buffer instead of Cstruct.create?

DONE dpid in init_switch_info?
Page 69 of 1.4.0

port name in port structure is ""

fix: hw_addr = Packet.mac_of_string (E.mac ethif) in Ofswitch.ml

fix: let tupple = (OP.Match.raw_packet_to_match in_port frame ) in Ofswitch.ml

fix flow_match_compare'

How to optionally ad port to the switch (like first version, remotely?) test?

name in init_port

mac address in init_port

ignore-change ethernet interface connected...

fix all warnings

packet priority?

Table-miss usage? At the moment, I think we just forward it to the controller. (Yes, in 0x01)

Table id?

Handling timeouts?

Group table

Statistics, use netif info instead of calculating it agian

Chech cache operation

IMP: usage of cache_entries in entry
